# This fork is kept to publish a Cognite version of react-scripts

Allows us to pull in new changes from the facebook repo, but still publish our own react-scripts.
The only package that is published in the @Cognite scope is [react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cognite/react-scripts)

To publish a new version see `packages/react-scripts`
